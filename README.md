# Email/SMS Spam Classifier

The Email/SMS Spam Classifier is a machine learning project designed to detect spam messages. The classifier is trained using a dataset of labeled spam and non-spam messages to learn patterns and characteristics indicative of spam. It can accurately classify incoming messages as spam or non-spam, helping users filter out unwanted and potentially harmful content.

## Key Features

- Utilizes machine learning algorithms to classify messages as spam or non-spam.
- Trained on a labeled dataset of spam and non-spam messages to learn patterns and characteristics.
- Offers high accuracy in detecting and filtering out spam content.
- Can be integrated into email clients or messaging applications for real-time spam detection.
- Easy to use and deploy, with simple and intuitive APIs for message classification.

## Technologies Used

- Python programming language
- Machine learning libraries (e.g., scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch)
- Data preprocessing techniques (e.g., tokenization, feature extraction)
- Classification algorithms (e.g., Naive Bayes, SVM, Random Forest)

## Usage

1. **Data Preprocessing**: The project includes scripts or modules for data preprocessing. This step involves cleaning the data, removing unnecessary characters or noise, and transforming text data into numerical representations (e.g., word embeddings, bag-of-words).

2. **Model Training**: Use the labeled dataset to train the machine learning model. Implement different algorithms and experiment with various hyperparameters to achieve the best classification performance.

3. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the trained model using appropriate evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) to assess its performance in classifying spam and non-spam messages.

4. **Integration**: Integrate the trained model into the desired application or system to classify incoming messages in real-time. This could involve developing APIs or integrating with existing email clients or messaging platforms.

## Dataset

The project utilizes a dataset of labeled spam and non-spam messages. The dataset consists of a collection of messages, each labeled as either spam or non-spam. The dataset is split into training and testing sets for model development and evaluation.
